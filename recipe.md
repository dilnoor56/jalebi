Mixing the oil with flour is important– rub it for good 3 to 4 minutes, do so by rubbing between your hands until the oil is well incorporated with the flour.

Don’t overwork the dough– you only need to bring the dough together. If you overwork it, the samosa will be hard.

Dough should be stiff– soft dough will not give crispy samosa.

Let the dough rest for around 40 minutes– always remember to let the dough rest for at least 30 to 40 minutes before you start making the samosa.

Roll the dough evenly and roll it thin– try to roll the dough thin and evenly. If the dough is rolled thick, it will take a long time for the dough to get cooked. Also we all like thin crispy edges of the samosa, agree?

But don’t roll it super thin too, else the dough will tear apart when you fill it.

Do not use any flour while rolling the samosa, you can apply little oil on your rolling pin.

Fry the samosa on low heat – the most important thing- always fry the samosa on low heat (not high, not medium), that way they will turn crisp.

Once they have become light brown in color (after 10 minutes or so), then you can increase the heat and fry on medium heat.

Also when you fry on low heat, they won’t get any blisters which they do when you drop them in hot oil.
